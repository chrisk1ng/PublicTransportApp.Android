<p><strong>How to Use a Minibus Taxi</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Know which neighbourhood your destination is in. (The app tells you the end destination of the taxi route you should look for.)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Find your taxi.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are near a taxi rank (a place with many parked taxis or building with many taxis), go there</strong>. Look for signs in the windshields that have the taxi&rsquo;s end destination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If you aren&rsquo;t near a taxi rank, </strong>stand at a street corner on a busy street. When a taxi approaches, raise one hand in the air out toward the street to signal you want to get on.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check the taxi&rsquo;s destination by asking the driver.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Board the taxi and take a seat.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pay for the taxi at any time during your trip. Hand CASH to conductor (the person at the sliding door).</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get off the taxi by signaling to the conductor to stop when you are near your destination (follow your location on the app if you aren&rsquo;t sure where you are).</strong></li>
</ul>
